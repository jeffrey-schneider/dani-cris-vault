| ID | Rule Summary | Enforced By | First Seen In | Emotional Purpose | Status | Notes |
|----|-----------------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------------|--------|-------|
| R01 | "Lift your head so I can see the collar" | Mateo | [[03_SilentRules_CollarLift]] | Submission without resistance | #active | Foundational rule, no physical force required |
| R02 | "Only speak when permitted" | Mateo | [[05_LossRevealed]] (implied) | Control through silence | #active | Consider formalizing this in a later scene |
| R03 | "Show me your throat" | Mateo | [[06_PublicFallout]] | Reinforces obedience with posture | #active | Pivotal symbolic moment‚Äîused sparingly |
| R04 | "You go first" (emotional) | Dani | [[08_TellMeYou‚ÄôllStay]] | Cris must act before she trusts | #emotional | Unspoken power inversion |
| R05 | "Don‚Äôt come home today" | Mateo (via Dani) | [[07_YouCanLeave]] | Create separation, establish control | #temporary | Cris obeys, Dani begins to collapse |
| R06 | "Beg for the trundle" | Dani | [[Unknown]] | Humbling ritual; tests commitment | #pending | May belong to future power arc thread |

## üìé Suggestions

- Create a file for each rule: `Rule_01_LiftHead.md`, etc.  
- In each rule file, use:
  - `linked_arcs: [[Arc_Dani]] [[Arc_Mateo]]`
  - `related_scenes: [[03_SilentRules_CollarLift]]`, etc.

- Track **challenges or defiance** to rules with backlinks
