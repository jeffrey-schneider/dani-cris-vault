# Rule 01 – “Lift Your Head So I Can See the Collar”

---

## 📜 Rule Description

This rule requires Dani to lift her head and make the collar visible whenever Mateo speaks to her. It’s the **first explicit verbal rule** issued by Mateo, and the moment Dani accepts it without resistance marks a major shift in their power dynamic.

---

## 🧠 Emotional Purpose

- **Surface**: A simple request for visibility and posture.
- **Subtext**: Reframes Dani’s silence into structure. She obeys calmly—**not because she’s broken, but because she’s begun to surrender willingly**.
- **Impact on Dani**: Initiates a shift from passive guilt to structured obedience.
- **Impact on Mateo**: Confirms his influence—she’s starting to accept behavioral framing without touch or force.

---

## 🧭 Usage Notes

- No physical movement from Mateo is needed—**his voice carries weight**.
- This rule becomes symbolic of a deeper theme: *“Let me see the version of you that admits what you’ve chosen.”*
- Never enforced harshly. Always **quiet. Deliberate. Inescapable.**
