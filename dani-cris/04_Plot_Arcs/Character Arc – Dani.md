## Phase 1: Self-Containment Cracks

2. [[02_Bedroom_Pullback]]  
*She offers herself, then denies himâ€”testing the boundaries of control, power, and shame.*

3. [[03_SilentRules_CollarLift]]

5. [[05_Scene_DaniCollarCeremony]]  
*Dani participates in a symbolic ceremony of surrender. Her identity begins to detach from herself.*

6. [[06_Scene_MateoClaimPhotograph]]  
*Mateo captures her obedience on camera. She allows it, feeling relief and horror simultaneously.*

11. [[11_Scene_RulesDiscussion]]  
*She redefines her limits, asserts boundaries, and begins to ask Crisâ€”not for permission, but for truth.*

## Arc Summary

Dani begins as a woman in control of everything **but herself**.

By the end, she no longer confuses control with love. She discovers that real power doesnâ€™t come from withholdingâ€”it comes from **being seen**, **being wanted**, and **choosing to return**.
