| Character | Emotional Shift | Trigger Scene |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|

## 🧠 Reflections & Themes

- **Dani**: Learns surrender and return are not opposites  
- **Cris**: Learns silence can be strength, but love requires visibility  
- **Mateo**: Learns control can shape someone—but it can't keep them

> Consider mirrored moments where one character gains as another loses.
