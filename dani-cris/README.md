# 📘 Dani & Cris – A Longform Novel Project

This vault is managed using the **Longform plugin** for Obsidian.  
It is structured for multi-scene fiction writing, using modular `.md` files stored in a dedicated manuscript folder.

---

## 🗂 Structure

### 📁 `02_Scenes/`
- All individual scenes or chapters are stored here
- Managed via Longform’s "Multi-Scene" mode
- Reordered using the Longform sidebar
- Files are standard Markdown (`.md`)

### 📄 `longform.json`
- Declares `02_Scenes/` as the manuscript folder
- Automatically created or updated by Longform

### 📁 `01_Characters/` *(optional)*
- Character snapshots, arcs, or notes (not required by Longform)

### 📁 `99_Reference/` *(optional)*
- Notes, worldbuilding, rules, timeline, scene tracker, etc.

## ✍️ Writing Workflow

1. Use the Longform panel to:
   - Reorder scenes
   - Mark which files are included in compile/export
2. Draft in Obsidian like normal
   - Use `#pov/dani`, `#emotion/devastation`, etc. if desired
3. Export via `Longform → Compile Manuscript` to `.md`, `.txt`, or `.docx`

## 🧠 Tips

- Use **drag-and-drop** to structure your story visually
- Scene status (e.g. `#draft`, `#done`) is optional but helpful
- Obsidian plugins like Dataview, Minimal Theme, or Style Settings enhance UX

## 📌 Notes

This project was originally designed with a deep structure of arcs, rules, and metadata, but has since been simplified for focus and clarity. Additional structure can be reintroduced later if needed.
