Excellent. Hereâ€™s a clean, reusable **scene header template** you can paste at the top of every scene `.md` file to organize your work and fully power your Obsidian vault, tags, and Graph View.

### âœ… Why This Works

- Every scene is **self-documenting**
    
- Tags drive **Graph View filtering**, color groups, and searches
    
- `related_rules` helps track when Mateoâ€™s structure is enforced
    
- `linked_arcs` connects your emotional landscape to story structure
    
- `status` helps you filter by progress when revising

### ðŸ§  Pro Tips

- Make this a **snippet or pinned note** so you can quickly copy-paste into new scene files
    
- You can even turn this into a template using the **Templater plugin** later
