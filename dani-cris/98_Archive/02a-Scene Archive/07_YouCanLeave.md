# Scene 07 – “The Offer to Walk Away”

> Dani tells Cris he can annul the marriage—he refuses

**

INT. DANI AND CRIS’S BEDROOM – SAME DAY

(Dani sits on the edge of the bed, staring out the window. Her hands rest in her lap, clasped together tightly. The room is quiet but for the hum of a box fan in the corner. Cris enters slowly.)

DANI:  
It really happened, didn’t it? They actually took him.

CRIS:  
Yeah. They did.

(She doesn’t smile. Doesn’t cry. Just breathes.)

DANI:  
I thought it would feel better. Like justice would rush in and make it all... less. But it just feels like someone buried me under the truth.

(Cris sits beside her. She doesn’t look at him, but she doesn’t pull away either.)

DANI:  
I wanted them to see. To know I wasn’t lying. But I didn’t want to be right. I didn’t want it to be this real.

EXT. CHURCH STEPS – SUNDAY MORNING

(A small congregation gathers outside after service. Whispers still linger, but now they’re tinged with remorse. The pastor steps forward and clears his throat.)

PASTOR:  
We failed someone in this community. We let fear and pride blind us. Today we ask forgiveness—not just from God—but from Dani Salinas, and from every woman we’ve silenced or doubted.

(A few heads bow. Others nod solemnly. A young couple walks toward Cris and Dani’s front porch later that afternoon, casserole dish in hand. Then another. And another. No apologies, not yet—but the offerings begin.)

INT. DANI AND CRIS’S LIVING ROOM – LATE NIGHT

(Dani sits curled in a corner of the couch, wearing one of Cris’s old sweatshirts. A casserole sits untouched on the kitchen counter. The lights are low. Cris is dozing lightly in an armchair across the room. Dani watches him for a moment—then steels herself.)

DANI:  
Cris... wake up.

(He stirs, blinking himself upright. His eyes focus on her, soft.)

CRIS:  
You okay?

DANI:  
I’ve been thinking... and I need to say something.

(She draws in a breath.)

DANI:  
There’s no baby anymore. People believe me now. They’re bringing casseroles and bowing their heads and pretending they didn’t whisper behind my back. And you... you don’t have to stay. We never consummated the marriage. You can get it annulled. You still have a life, Cris. You can walk away with a clean name. I won’t fight you on it. I promise.

(She says the last part quickly, trying to stay composed. Cris doesn’t answer immediately. He stands, walks over to her, and kneels.)

CRIS:  
You think I married you because of a baby? Because of guilt? Dani... I married you because I love you. I took my vows. You took yours. That wasn’t a placeholder—that was a covenant. I’m not leaving. Not today. Not ever.

(He reaches up, brushes a tear from her cheek.)

CRIS:  
We’re husband and wife. I’m not going anywhere... except by your side.

DANI:  
Don’t say that like it’s simple. Like it’s easy. You don’t get it, Cris—I’m shattered. I’m half a woman and not a mother. I’m the girl who makes people avert their eyes in the grocery store.

(She stands, pacing now, arms crossed tight over her chest.)

DANI:  
You could still have a family. A future. You deserve someone who isn’t carrying this much broken history. You deserve better than me.

CRIS:  
No. I deserve you. Not because you're perfect—but because you’re real. Because when I look at you, I see a woman who faced hell and kept walking. And I will spend every day making sure you never walk it alone again.

(Dani slows, back still to him. Her breath catches, shoulders trembling. She wants to argue more—but something inside her begins to shift.)

DANI:  
Then prove it.

(She turns, arms still folded, face set like stone—but her eyes betray her vulnerability.)

DANI:  
Tell me you’ll stay even when I scream in my sleep. When I flinch at your touch. When I can’t get out of bed. Tell me you’ll stay even when I don’t know how to love you back. Even when I make it hard to love me at all.

(She steps closer—not soft, but fierce in her hurt.)

DANI:  
Because if you can’t promise that, Cris... I need to know now. Before I fall any harder than I already have.

CRIS:  
Then hear me now, Dani—yes. I promise. I’ll be there when you scream, when you flinch, when you shut down. I’ll be there when you can’t love me back, and when you think you never will. I will hold you when you're shaking, stand back when you need space, and stay grounded when everything else falls apart.

(He steps forward, voice low and unwavering.)

CRIS:  
You asked me to prove it—so remember this. When I was twelve and you beat me in every single event at the church picnic, I never stopped chasing you. When we were sixteen and I didn’t kiss you at the drive-in, I thought about it every day for a year. And when I heard what happened, I didn't hesitate—I came straight to you. Not to fix you. To find you. Because you are the girl I’ve always loved.

(He reaches out and gently takes her hands.)

CRIS:  
So no matter how broken you think you are... I’m already here. I’m not afraid of the dark. I’m not afraid of the scars. I married you, Dani. I will stay married to you.

(A beat of silence. Then—)

CRIS:  
Now fall. I’ll catch you.

(Dani stands frozen, heart pounding in her chest. She wants to fight him still, to throw up one last wall just in case he doesn't mean it. But she sees his face—open, steady, unmoving. No fear. No pity. Just love.)

(And then, like a tide finally letting go, she breaks. Her knees give out and she falls into him—not gracefully, but with all the weight of grief, confusion, and reluctant hope. Cris catches her, just like he promised.)

(For a long time, neither of them speaks. Her tears soak his shoulder. His arms tighten around her.)

(Finally, in the softest voice—)

DANI:  
Okay.

(A beat.)

DANI:  
You caught me.

(FADE TO BLACK.)
