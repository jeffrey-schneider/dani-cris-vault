# Scene 06 – “The Town Wakes Up”

> Her father arrested, the town begins to understand

**

EXT. MAIN STREET – DAY

(A week later. News has spread. The gossiping has stopped. The mood is somber. People whisper, but this time it’s not mockery—it’s fear, and guilt, and dawning shame.)

(Sheriff’s deputies escort a stern-faced man in handcuffs—Dani’s father—out of his house. He keeps his head down as news cameras and townsfolk watch. An agent from the state stands nearby, reviewing evidence with a clipboard.)

TOWNSWOMAN 1:  
They said the autopsy confirmed it.

TOWNSMAN 1:  
Should’ve believed her from the start.

TOWNSWOMAN 2:  
I always said something was off about that man. Didn’t I say?

(No one answers her. They just watch, ashamed. A handful cross themselves. One old man removes his hat.)

(The patrol car doors shut. The engine rumbles. The car pulls away slowly, and with it, the last shred of the town’s denial.)
