# Scene 02 – “I'll Carry You”

> Cris shows up at Dani’s door and refuses to let her go

*Scene body begins here...*
**

INT. DANI’S APARTMENT – EVENING

DANI: (arms crossed, trembling) Fine. Come in. Don’t touch anything.

(She opens the door fully, stepping back. Cris walks in. He sees the pill bottles on the kitchen counter. The unopened rum. The glass beside it—bone dry. His face tightens, but he doesn’t comment. Not yet.)

CRIS: You still drink that cheap rum? God, that stuff tastes like motor oil.

DANI: (sharp) It’s not for tasting.

(A beat. Cris doesn’t reply. He walks over, picks up the rum bottle, and silently sets it inside the cabinet above the fridge. She watches him, stiff, bracing.)

DANI: Don’t play house with me, Cris. You don’t get to pretend like this is normal.

CRIS: It’s not normal.  
(He turns to face her, finally. Firm. Quiet.)  
You don’t look normal. You look like someone who’s ready to disappear. And if I got here even one hour later, I think you might’ve tried.

(She says nothing. Her jaw clenches. Her hands shake. But she doesn’t deny it.)

CRIS: I’m not here because I feel sorry for you. I’m here because I still love you.  
And because I can’t let you go like this.

DANI: (bitter laugh) You love me? You love this? A disgrace. A freak. The town joke.  
Everyone thinks I made the whole thing up.  
I hear them. "It wasn’t her dad. He’s too respected. She’s just hiding some hookup."  
They think I’m just another small-town slut who got caught.

(Tears start rising. She wipes them furiously.)

DANI: And now I’m going to be someone’s mother? Cris, I can’t even stand being someone’s daughter.

(Cris crosses the room. Slowly. Carefully. When he speaks next, his voice is just above a whisper.)

CRIS: You don’t have to be strong right now. Not for me. Not for anybody.  
But you do have to stay.  
Because this world is a better place with you in it.  
And that kid? That kid’s going to need someone just like you. Someone brave enough to survive being invisible.

(A long silence. Dani doesn’t look at him, but she doesn't move either.)

CRIS: Marry me.

DANI: (choked laugh) That’s not funny.

CRIS: Not a joke.

DANI: You don’t want a broken girl, Cris. You want a wife, not a reclamation project.

CRIS: I want you. All of you. Even the broken pieces. Especially those.

DANI: (screaming through tears) You are full of shit, Cris. Nobody—and I mean nobody—in this town wants me. They don't believe me. They call me a liar. They take his side. Fuck 'em all. And you too, Cris. Get the hell out! Let me go! Let me go, damn you!

CRIS: Dani, I won't let you go. Not like this.

(She shoves him—hard. Her palms strike his chest, once, twice. He doesn't move. He just takes it. Her tears are pouring now, hot and bitter.)

CRIS: I'll be your child's daddy. Give me a chance. Let me try. Dani, there’s two of you now—let me help carry that duty, that privilege. I can be a dad.

DANI: (quieter, but still fierce) No, Cris. No. You can't just ride in and fix this. I'm not some stray you can rescue. This isn't a fairy tale. You think love makes this all okay?

(She looks away. Her voice breaks slightly.)

DANI: But... thank you. For saying it. For wanting to.

(She wipes her eyes again, slower this time. Not calm, but no longer thrashing.)

CRIS: I’m not here because it’s easy. Or because I don’t have other options. I’m here because you matter more than all of them. I’ll give up my name, my job, my future—whatever it takes. Let them talk. Let them sneer. I don’t care.

(He steps closer, steady. No hesitation.)

CRIS: Just give me a chance, Dani. Let me show you what I can do. Not with words—with work. With showing up. With staying. Let me fight for you like you deserve to be fought for.

(As he speaks, Cris begins quietly collecting the pill bottles from the counter one by one, slipping them into his coat pocket when she isn’t looking. His movements are deliberate but gentle—like he’s handling something sacred. He picks up the glass last, sets it in the sink, and wipes the counter with the edge of his sleeve.)

CRIS: Pills aren’t the answer. We are the answer, Dani. We are the answer.

(Dani turns sharply and sees what he’s done. Her eyes lock onto his coat pocket—just visible, the edge of a prescription label peeking out. Her voice drops, low and dangerous.)

DANI: You think I didn’t see that? You think I’m stupid?

(She storms over and snatches the coat from his hands, shaking it. The bottles tumble out onto the floor, clattering like accusations.)

DANI: You don’t get to come in here and clean up my mess like it’s yours to fix. You don’t get to erase the worst part of me like it never happened.

(A beat. She breathes hard, chest rising and falling. But she doesn’t throw him out. Not this time.)

(Then—snap. Dani loses control. Her hand lashes out and slaps him, hard, across the cheek. The sound echoes in the small apartment. Cris doesn't flinch. He just absorbs it, steady and quiet.)

DANI: (through sobs) It’s not fair. It’s not fair! I didn’t do anything wrong. I didn’t ask for this—any of this!

(She hits him again, fists closed this time, pounding once against his chest.)

DANI: I hate that he did this to me. I hate that everyone thinks I'm the liar. That I have to carry this! That my baby has to carry this!

(She doesn't crumple yet. Instead, she swings again—this time, her nails catch his cheek. A line of blood rises slowly as Cris reels back a step but doesn't raise a hand. He steadies himself, blinking through the sting.)

(Dani sees it. The blood. Her breath catches. The fire in her chest dims—not gone, but focused.)

DANI: (quieter, trembling) Shit... Cris...

(She moves without thinking, grabs a dish towel from the drawer and presses it to his face with shaking hands.)

DANI: I didn’t mean—God, I didn’t mean to do that. I didn’t...

(She fusses over the cut like nothing else has happened, like they’re just any couple with a clumsy kitchen accident. Her world stabilizing, one bandage at a time.)

(Cris gently reaches up and touches her arm, his fingers barely resting there.)

CRIS: I’ve never stopped loving you, Dani.

DANI: How? Why? After I threw you out? Why do you love me, Cris? Why me, why you?

CRIS: Because the first time I saw you, I felt something I couldn’t name—like God whispered your name in my chest. Because when you walk into a room, it’s like my lungs start working again. And even when we broke up, even when I hated how much I missed you... I knew.

(He looks her straight in the eyes—gentle, sure.)

CRIS: You're the bravest person I know. And I don’t care what anyone else says. I know who you are. That’s why it’s you. Always has been.

DANI: Brave, shit. Hell, it wasn't bravery that got me into this situation. It was a bunch of ignorant dickheads ignoring what they had to have seen. They must have known.

(Her voice trembles, not from fear—but fury.)

DANI: Cris, why didn't anyone help me? Why didn't they believe me?

(She swipes at her face, angry now. Hurt but clear. This is the root of it. No one saw her. They only saw him. And in 1985, that's all it took.)

CRIS: Because people would rather protect a lie than confront a monster in their own church pew. Because in a town like this, a man’s reputation matters more than a girl’s soul. And I hate it, Dani. I hate that they made you carry this alone.

(He kneels so they’re eye to eye—his voice soft, but steady.)

CRIS: But I see you. I’ve always seen you. And I will never—not once—pretend I don’t believe you. You survived something evil. That doesn’t make you broken. That makes you holy in a way most people wouldn’t understand.

(Dani studies him, her expression unreadable. Then, in a voice barely above a whisper.)

DANI: Then tell me the truth, Cris. If I never get better... if the town never changes... if I scream in my sleep for the rest of my life—are you still staying?

(She watches him closely, needing more than comfort now. Needing conviction.)

CRIS: Yes, babe. I'm staying. No matter what. I'd rather have a bad day with you than an eternity in heaven.

(He pauses, a small wry smile tugging at one side of his mouth.)

CRIS: Well... let me qualify that.

DANI: You aren't pitying me, are you? If you are offering all this just because you feel sorry for me, go the hell away. I don't need that shit right now.

(Then her voice cracks, and suddenly she's weeping—openly, helplessly. The weight crashes down all at once.)

DANI: 'Cause right now, you are all I have, Cris. If you are screwing with me, I... I can't take that. The pills would be better.

(Her eyes lock with his—wide, desperate, afraid. There's no mask now, no armor. Just need.)

DANI: Don't fuck with me, Cris. I can't survive that.

CRIS: Then I won’t. I swear it before God. I’m not here out of pity, or guilt, or some twisted savior complex. I’m here because I was made for this—made for you. I don’t have all the answers, but I have arms that will hold you, a heart that already does, and a spine that won’t break just because life gets hard.

(He reaches forward and draws her into his arms. No urgency. Just warmth. Just presence. Her head rests against his chest, and for the first time in a long while—she lets it.)

DANI: (muffled against his chest) I don’t deserve you.

(A pause. She sniffles, then shakes her head, correcting herself in a whisper.)

DANI: No… no, that’s not true. I do. I deserve someone who sees me. I just… I forgot what that felt like.

(She presses her face deeper into him, clinging now—not to be saved, but to remember what it feels like to matter.)

DANI: Hold me, Cris. Just... don’t let go.

(He holds her tighter, his chin resting lightly atop her head. Silence falls for a moment. Then, softly—)

CRIS: I have to use your phone.

(She doesn’t question it. She just nods against his chest. He reaches for the phone on the wall, dialing a number from memory. It rings once.)

CRIS: Hey, Dad. It’s me. I’m with her. She’s... she’s safe now. I just wanted you to know.

(A pause. Cris listens, eyes still on Dani.)

CRIS: Yeah. You were right. She didn’t need a sermon—she needed someone to show up. And I’m staying.

(He hangs up, slowly. Then speaks to Dani, his voice low.)

CRIS: My dad told me what happened. Told me the truth—what everyone else wouldn’t say out loud. He looked me in the eye, Dani, and told me, "If you don’t go to her now, you’ll never forgive yourself. And neither will I."

(Dani lifts her head slightly, her voice barely a whisper.)

DANI: What else did your dad say?

CRIS: He said, "Son, if you still think about her, if her name still hits you in the chest when you hear it, then she’s not gone. She’s waiting. And if you make her wait too long, you’ll lose her—and yourself. So go. Go now. Don’t ask your mother. Don’t pack a bag. Just go. That girl needs you more than you need to be safe."

DANI: He believes me?

CRIS: Yeah. He knows what a bastard your father is.

(Cris gives her a faint, dry smile.)

CRIS: Don’t worry though—he lost the keys to his gun safe, so the gun is safe in the house.

(Dani studies his face for a long moment. Her eyes shimmer, not with fear now, but something else—something fragile and grateful. Slowly, hesitantly, she leans in. Her lips brush his—soft, unsure—just once. Then again, with more certainty. A kiss not born of passion, but of faith. Of choosing to believe.)

DANI: Please stay, Cris. Unless you worry that association with me will sully your reputation.

CRIS: If we’re gonna get married, the town will have to get used to seeing me around.

(Dani blinks, caught off guard. For once, she doesn’t know what to say. Her lips part, but no words come. Only the sound of her breath hitching, and a slow, stunned smile that dares to hope.)

DANI: You were kidding, right?

(She tries to sound casual, even teasing, but the tremble in her voice betrays her. Her fingers twist nervously in the hem of her shirt.)

DANI: I mean, you don’t just walk in and propose marriage to a mess like me. That’s not how real life works. Right?

(But she’s not pushing him away now—she’s bracing for disappointment, for the moment he laughs it off and steps back. She wants to believe, but it’s all happening so fast.)

CRIS: Oh, baby girl. I have never been more serious in my life. I don't have a ring right now, so you'll have to find a bread tie, but you and I are gonna get hitched and 'right soon!

DANI: We’ve been separated for so long... you don’t know me anymore.

DANI: And Cris, there's one more thing. I'm six months along and I haven't felt the baby kick in a couple of days. Babies born in a situation like this have more birth defects and I don't want to burden you with that. You have given me a rock to fall on and a shoulder to cry on and your warmth. I can't ask you for anymore. Please, just give me your phone number and let me talk to you when I need a friend.

CRIS: Dani, you need me and I want you. I have wanted you since we were little. I have watched you grow—and you likewise. I cannot leave without meeting my destiny. Don't force me away. Dani, I need and want to be with you.

(Dani pulls back slightly, her hands still resting lightly on his arms. Her face is uncertain again—hope wrestling with disbelief.)

DANI: But why? You have your whole life ahead of you, Cris. A job. A name. A clean slate. I’m not that. I’m what people whisper about in the grocery store. I’m trouble. Complicated. Tired. And terrified.

(She looks at him through shimmering eyes.)

DANI: You’d give all that up... for me?

CRIS: Yes. A thousand times, yes. Because what is a clean slate if it doesn't have your name written on it? What is a job, a name, a reputation—if it doesn’t include coming home to you?

(He cups her face, gently, like she might break but also like she might save him.)

CRIS: You think you're trouble, Dani? I think you're the kind of miracle that scares people. Because you're strong, and you're loud, and you're honest. And they don't know what to do with that. But I do. I want to build a life with that.

(His voice drops, more intimate.)

CRIS: I want to wake up and see your face—even if it's tear-streaked. I want to go to sleep knowing I stood beside you, even if the world’s still whispering. I want to be the guy who held you through your worst and never let go.

(He lets the silence breathe, then adds one more line.)

CRIS: So yes, Dani. I'd give it all up—because loving you isn't losing anything. It's finally becoming who I was supposed to be.

(Dani stares at him, breath caught. She wants to believe. Every cell in her body aches to believe. But still—one last defense rises up.)

DANI: And what if I can’t love you the way you deserve? What if all I’ve got is broken pieces and borrowed strength? What if... what if I never stop being afraid?

CRIS: Then I’ll love you through the fear. Through the silence. Through every jagged edge and sleepless night.

(He draws her hands into his and holds them firmly between them.)

CRIS: I don’t need you to be perfect. I need you to let me stay. I’ll carry us both, Dani, until you can walk beside me. And even then, I’ll never let go.

CRIS: Marry me, Dani. We can go a long way together. Marry me. Just say yes.

(FADE TO BLACK.)
