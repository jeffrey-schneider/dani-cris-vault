# Scene 04 – “The First Night”

> Peaceful wedding night, no rush, emotional closeness

**

INT. RENTED LAKE CABIN – THAT EVENING

(The cabin is modest and cozy. Cris sets their overnight bags down. Dani sits slowly on the edge of the bed, running a hand across her belly.)

DANI:  
Your dad really did all this?

CRIS:  
Booked it, stocked the fridge, left a note on the table. Said, "Make her feel safe." And "Don’t screw it up."

(They share a small laugh. Dani winces slightly and adjusts how she's sitting. Cris notices and softens.)

CRIS:  
We don’t have to... you know, not tonight. We’ve got time.

DANI:  
Yeah. I know. I’m not saying I don’t want to—I just... today’s been a lot.

CRIS:  
Hey. Just being next to you is enough. We don’t need to rush anything.

(He walks over and sits beside her. She leans into him, her head resting on his shoulder. The crickets chir outside. The lake ripples softly through the open window.)

DANI:  
This isn’t how I pictured it. But it’s... better. I think it’s better.

CRIS:  
It is. Because it’s real.

(They sit together in silence, husband and wife, letting the peace of the lake cradle what comes next.)

INT. OB/GYN EXAM ROOM – TWO DAYS LATER

(The fluorescent lighting hums quietly. Dani lies on the table, the ultrasound wand gliding over her belly. Cris sits beside her, holding her hand. The technician frowns and shifts angles several times. A long silence.)

TECHNICIAN:  
Excuse me a moment. I’m going to get the doctor.

(Moments later, the OB/GYN enters and takes over. The room is too quiet. The screen still. The doctor finally looks at them—measured, serious.)

OB/GYN:  
I'm very sorry... there's no heartbeat.

(Dani stiffens. Cris's hand tightens around hers.)

OB/GYN:  
From what we can see on this first ultrasound... your baby boy had several significant abnormalities—conditions we call incompatible with life. Severe congenital heart defects, primary congenital hydrocephalus, and what appears to be severe spina bifida.

(Dani goes pale. Her other hand instinctively covers her belly.)

OB/GYN (CONT'D):  
An autopsy would confirm more details. Given the history, there will also be a forensic component to determine parentage. I'm so sorry.

(Silence. Dani swallows but says nothing. Cris doesn’t let go.)

DANI:  
So... that's it? He's just gone?

OB/GYN:  
I’m afraid so. And because of the nature of the case, there will be mandatory procedures. The state will order a full autopsy—not just to determine the cause of death, but to establish certain legal facts. I want to be honest with you both—there will be a forensic analysis to determine parentage.

(Dani flinches. Cris's jaw tightens. He draws her hand into both of his.)

CRIS:  
We understand. Do what you have to. But please—treat him gently. He was wanted.

(Dani turns her head away, tears sliding silently onto the paper-covered table. She speaks so quietly it’s nearly a whisper.)

DANI:  
He was mine. No matter how he got here... he was still mine.

(Cris leans in, resting his forehead against hers.)

CRIS:  
He still is. And so are you.**
