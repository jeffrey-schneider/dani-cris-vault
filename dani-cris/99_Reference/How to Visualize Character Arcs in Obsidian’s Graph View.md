How to Visualize Character Arcs in Obsidian’s Graph View
Perfect. Let’s take this to the next level and unlock the **Graph View** in Obsidian as a **living character map**.

You’ll be able to **visually trace**:

- Which scenes belong to which arc
    
- Where characters intersect
    
- How emotional tags cluster across the narrative

## ✅ How to Visualize Character Arcs in Obsidian’s Graph View

### 🔹 Step 1: Tag Each Scene with Character Arc Metadata

In each scene `.md` file, add something like this at the top or bottom:

```markdown
# Metadata
#pov/dani #arc/dani #emotion/erosion #scene/porch
```

- `#pov/dani` links to her perspective
    
- `#arc/dani` marks it as part of her character arc
    
- `#emotion/erosion` helps you trace internal states across scenes
    
- `#scene/porch` tracks physical setting
    

Add `#arc/cris` or `#arc/mateo` in their relevant scenes too.

### 🔹 Step 2: Open the Graph View

1. Click the **Graph View** icon (🧭 or ⚛️) in the left sidebar
    
2. This shows all files and links in your vault as a network of nodes

### 🔹 Step 3: Filter for Character Arcs

In the **Graph View filter panel**:

- Click the **filter funnel icon** at the top right
    
- Under “Tags,” enter:
    
    - `#arc/dani` to highlight all of Dani’s arc scenes
        
    - `#arc/cris` or `#arc/mateo` for the others
        

You’ll now see all her arc scenes cluster visually—usually near character notes, rules, or reflections if they’re linked.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Use Color Groups (Optional, But Awesome)

Go to:

> `Settings → Graph View → Groups`

Create a group rule like:

```yaml
Group name: Dani Arc
Type: Tag
Tag: arc/dani
Color: purple
```

Do this for Cris (`blue`), Mateo (`red`), etc.

Now your graph shows **color-coded clusters** for each character’s arc!

### 🧠 Tip: Use Links Strategically

- Link scenes back to `[[Arc_Dani]]` or `[[Character_Matrix]]` for deeper context
    
- Link key emotional turning points to `[[Plot_Themes.md]]` if you build one later

Would you like a sample scene header template that includes all these metadata tags and structure hints? It’ll speed things up as you draft.
