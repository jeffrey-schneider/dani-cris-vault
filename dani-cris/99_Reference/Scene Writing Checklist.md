Fantastic. Hereâ€™s a compact, practical **Scene Writing Checklist Template** you can paste into each `.md` fileâ€”right under the frontmatter or just above the scene body.

Itâ€™s designed to guide you through drafting with emotional focus, structure, and internal clarity without slowing your flow.

### ðŸ“„ Scene Writing Checklist (Paste into Any Scene)

```markdown
## ðŸ§­ Scene Checklist (Optional)

- **POV Character Emotion at Start**:  
  _(What are they feeling as the scene begins?)_

- **Core Conflict or Shift**:  
  _(What changes by the end of this scene?)_

- **What Is Shown (Action)**:  
  _(Physical movement, events, behavior)_

- **What Is Felt (Emotion)**:  
  _(Reactions, private thoughts, emotional build or collapse)_

- **What Is Said (Dialogue)**:  
  _(One or two lines that reveal truth, tension, or character)_

- **What the Reader Learns**:  
  _(Backstory, secret, rule, relationship truth?)_

- **Scene Hook or Exit Line**:  
  _(Last line to echo or transition to the next scene)_
```

### âœ… How to Use

- Paste once per `.md` scene file
    
- Fill out before or after writing (or leave blank during first draft)
    
- Later, use it to **evaluate** if your scene is working emotionally or structurally
    

Would you like a similar checklist for **rule notes** or **character turning points**?
