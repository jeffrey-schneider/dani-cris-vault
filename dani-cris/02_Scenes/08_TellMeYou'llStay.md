# Scene 08 – “Fall Into Me”

> Dani dares Cris to promise—and he does, unflinchingly

**

DANI:  
Tell me you’ll stay even when I scream in my sleep. When I flinch at your touch. When I can’t get out of bed. Tell me you’ll stay even when I don’t know how to love you back. Even when I make it hard to love me at all.

(She steps closer—not soft, but fierce in her hurt.)

DANI:  
Because if you can’t promise that, Cris... I need to know now. Before I fall any harder than I already have.

CRIS:  
Then hear me now, Dani—yes. I promise. I’ll be there when you scream, when you flinch, when you shut down. I’ll be there when you can’t love me back, and when you think you never will. I will hold you when you're shaking, stand back when you need space, and stay grounded when everything else falls apart.

(He steps forward, voice low and unwavering.)

CRIS:  
You asked me to prove it—so remember this. When I was twelve and you beat me in every single event at the church picnic, I never stopped chasing you. When we were sixteen and I didn’t kiss you at the drive-in, I thought about it every day for a year. And when I heard what happened, I didn't hesitate—I came straight to you. Not to fix you. To find you. Because you are the girl I’ve always loved.

(He reaches out and gently takes her hands.)

CRIS:  
So no matter how broken you think you are... I’m already here. I’m not afraid of the dark. I’m not afraid of the scars. I married you, Dani. I will stay married to you.

(A beat of silence. Then—)

CRIS:  
Now fall. I’ll catch you.

(Dani stands frozen, heart pounding in her chest. She wants to fight him still, to throw up one last wall just in case he doesn't mean it. But she sees his face—open, steady, unmoving. No fear. No pity. Just love.)

(And then, like a tide finally letting go, she breaks. Her knees give out and she falls into him—not gracefully, but with all the weight of grief, confusion, and reluctant hope. Cris catches her, just like he promised.)

(For a long time, neither of them speaks. Her tears soak his shoulder. His arms tighten around her.)

(Finally, in the softest voice—)

DANI:  
Okay.

(A beat.)

DANI:  
You caught me.

(FADE TO BLACK.)
