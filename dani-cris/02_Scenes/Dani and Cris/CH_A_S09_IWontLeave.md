# Scene 09 – The Offer to Leave

> Dani gives Cris an out; he refuses and reaffirms his vows**

>>>INT. DANI AND CRIS’S BEDROOM – SAME DAY

(Dani sits on the edge of the bed, staring out the window. Her hands rest in her lap, clasped together tightly. The room is quiet but for the hum of a box fan in the corner. Cris enters slowly.)

DANI:  
It really happened, didn’t it? They actually took him.

CRIS:  
Yeah. They did.

(She doesn’t smile. Doesn’t cry. Just breathes.)

DANI:  
I thought it would feel better. Like justice would rush in and make it all... less. But it just feels like someone buried me under the truth.

(Cris sits beside her. She doesn’t look at him, but she doesn’t pull away either.)

DANI:  
I wanted them to see. To know I wasn’t lying. But I didn’t want to be right. I didn’t want it to be this real.

>>>EXT. CHURCH STEPS – SUNDAY MORNING

(A small congregation gathers outside after service. Whispers still linger, but now they’re tinged with remorse. The pastor steps forward and clears his throat.)

PASTOR:  
We failed someone in this community. We let fear and pride blind us. Today we ask forgiveness—not just from God—but from Dani Salinas, and from every woman we’ve silenced or doubted.

(A few heads bow. Others nod solemnly. A young couple walks toward Cris and Dani’s front porch later that afternoon, casserole dish in hand. Then another. And another. No apologies, not yet—but the offerings begin.)
