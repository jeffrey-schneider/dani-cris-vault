# Scene 07 – No Heartbeat

> The ultrasound confirms the baby is gone; legal investigation begins**

>>>Int. Ob/Gyn Exam Room – Two Days Later

(The fluorescent lighting hums quietly. Dani lies on the table, the ultrasound wand gliding over her belly. Cris sits beside her, holding her hand. The technician frowns and shifts angles several times. A long silence.)

TECHNICIAN:  
Excuse me a moment. I’m going to get the doctor.

(Moments later, the OB/GYN enters and takes over. The room is too quiet. The screen still. The doctor finally looks at them—measured, serious.)

OB/GYN:  
I'm very sorry... there's no heartbeat.

(Dani stiffens. Cris's hand tightens around hers.)

OB/GYN:  
From what we can see on this first ultrasound... your baby boy had several significant abnormalities—conditions we call incompatible with life. Severe congenital heart defects, primary congenital hydrocephalus, and what appears to be severe spina bifida.

(Dani goes pale. Her other hand instinctively covers her belly.)

OB/GYN (CONT'D):  
An autopsy would confirm more details. Given the history, there will also be a forensic component to determine parentage. I'm so sorry.

(Silence. Dani swallows but says nothing. Cris doesn’t let go.)

DANI:  
So... that's it? He's just gone?

OB/GYN:  
I’m afraid so. And because of the nature of the case, there will be mandatory procedures. The state will order a full autopsy—not just to determine the cause of death, but to establish certain legal facts. I want to be honest with you both—there will be a forensic analysis to determine parentage.

(Dani flinches. Cris's jaw tightens. He draws her hand into both of his.)

CRIS:  
We understand. Do what you have to. But please—treat him gently. He was wanted.

(Dani turns her head away, tears sliding silently onto the paper-covered table. She speaks so quietly it’s nearly a whisper.)

DANI:  
He was mine. No matter how he got here... he was still mine.

(Cris leans in, resting his forehead against hers.)

CRIS:  
He still is. And so are you.

>>>INT. CRIS’S PARENTS’ KITCHEN – NIGHT

(Cris sits at the kitchen table across from his father, a coffee mug in his hands. The room is quiet. A clock ticks softly. Dani is resting upstairs.)

CRIS:  
It’s confirmed. No heartbeat. The baby... he had too many problems. The doc said they were incompatible with life.

FATHER:  
I’m so sorry, son.

CRIS:  
They’re doing a full autopsy. State-mandated. Forensic exam to establish paternity.

(His father exhales heavily, rubbing his face.)

FATHER:  
They’ll find the truth. And maybe... maybe now people will believe her. Maybe now they’ll see what kind of man her father really is.

CRIS:  
They need to. She’s barely holding together. And if they don’t make him answer for this, I swear...

FATHER:  
You just take care of Dani. Let the law handle the rest. I’ll make a few calls myself.****
