# Scene 05 – I Do, Anyway

> They marry at the courthouse under judgmental eyes

*Paste or write your scene content below...*
Ext. Town Courthouse – Midday

(A small group of townsfolk gathers on the steps outside the courthouse, whispering and giggling behind cupped hands. Word spreads fast in a town like this—and Cris and Dani’s unexpected wedding is the story of the week.)

(Cris stands tall in a clean button-down and jeans. Dani wears a pale blue sundress stretched tight over her baby bump. She looks both nervous and defiant as she squeezes his hand. The Justice of the Peace clears his throat, ready to begin.)

JUSTICE OF THE PEACE:  
Do you, Cristian Luis Salinas, take this woman, Daniela Ardis, to be your lawfully wedded wife?

CRIS:  
I do.

JUSTICE OF THE PEACE:  
And do you, Daniela Ardis, take this man, Cristian Luis, to be your lawfully wedded husband?

(Dani hesitates for the briefest moment—then nods, eyes locked on Cris.)

DANI:  
I do.

JUSTICE OF THE PEACE:  
Then by the authority vested in me by the state of Oklahoma, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss—

(Cris pulls Dani gently into a kiss. The townspeople titter and clap, some with genuine warmth, others with gleeful judgment. Dani hears them but doesn’t care. Not today.)
