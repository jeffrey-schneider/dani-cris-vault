# Scene 01 – “The Return”

> Cris hears the truth from his father and decides to find Dani


They don’t talk about it, haven’t for years.  They know the truth. The reason that Cris married Dani is that he knows that she is his angel. He knows that he could survive without her, love does not equal need, but by God, his world, his life, his existence would be meaningless without her. 

He was 25 and she was 22\. She was pregnant, pregnant in a way that no one talks about. He wasn’t the father. He didn’t give a damn that he wasn’t the father. She needed someone to see her, someone to rescue her. Nobody, I mean nobody, gave a shit if she or the friggin’ kid lived or died. In fact, it would be much easier if that kid was stillborn and if she had never been born. She was an embarrassment. For her to get pregnant outside of wedlock was shameful in the 80’s. 

Shameless hussy, got pregnant and wouldn’t tell anyone who the damn father was.  Pride or some shit. Stupid bitch, who the hell did she think she was.  Gymnast, hell. She just was someone to spread her legs and trap some innocent sperm donor into being an ATM for an unwed mother and her bastard for 18 years.  

Cris and Dani had dated  a while back and decided that they were not meant for each other.  Cris was a hard man to love. He couldn’t show it like others. He was a stoic and he couldn’t turn it on and off like Dani needed him to. They couldn’t believe that they were made for each other.  Dani needed a man who would shrivel up and die if he lost her. A man who couldn’t survive without her being by his side.  A man who believed that need equaled love.  

Cris was not that man. He couldn’t be that man, not ever.  Deep inside, he loved Dani, more than he loved anyone else in the world, but he loved her because of the way she made him feel, the way she laughed, the way she held his hand and the way she kissed him goodnight.  And then the way she kissed him goodbye.

Oddly enough, Dani let him go and even though she didn’t pay attention at the time, she survived without him, without the one who loved her so much. Without the one who completed her. She had a very hard time letting go, but she didn’t collapse and die when she saw him driving around town without her. She never thought about it, but she was proving his stoic beliefs every day.

Cris heard the rumors, the vicious tales that would break a strong person, that dehumanized and stripped a person of all self respect. He was back in town to visit his parents and his mom told him how lucky he was to have ducked that Dani bullet.  She seduced someone and then got pregnant and now someone was stuck.  His mom was pretty cruel about the whole thing and Cris didn’t understand why she was so bitter over something that wasn’t her business.  

Cris’s dad put it all right, though. What his dad said, if true, explained why everyone was so against Dani.  His father, the source of his stoicism, did not lie and the tale he told Cris broke his heart.  He looked at his son and the tears in his dad’s eyes told him everything he’d need to know.  Cris was stoic, but that didn’t mean he didn’t believe in divine intervention.  In fact, Cris was a heavy, heavy believer in God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. He was not religious in an organized way, but he knew what he knew.

And the night that his dad looked in his eyes, he knew that someone, something was sending him somewhere he had never thought about going.  He learned his life’s purpose at his father’s knee and from his father’s knowing gaze.  His father answered the only question Cris had.

Cris excused himself from his mom and jumped into his car.  He drove to the address his dad had given him, the answer he’d needed to the only question that mattered.  Cris was so nervous he threw up in the bushes.  He wiped his face and then knocked on the door.

He barely recognized the woman who opened the door. She was six months pregnant, wearing ill fitting maternity pants and a torn t-shirt.  She had been crying, her eyes were so red. She was sick, pregnancy was hard on her. She didn’t look like the gymnast he dated a couple of years before.  

“What are you doing here?” she asked, harsher than she needed to be.  She thought, ‘He’s just here to laugh and give me shit and tell me what a rotten bitch I am.  Asshole. I don’t need shit from him, I’ve got enough to worry about.’

“Dani, can I come in?”

“No, I’m not seeing guests tonight.  I am getting ready to go out on the town.”

“Dani, I see you, I hear you, You are not invisible. I can help.”

“What the hell can you do? How can you help me?  What do you think I am a damn punching bag? What can you do Cris?  Why are you here? To laugh at me?  Well here I am Cris, laugh at me, stupid bastard.”

“Dani, I can laugh harder and better if I could come in.”*Scene body begins here...*
