# Scene 06 – First Night

> They spend a quiet wedding night at the lake house

**

>>>INT. RENTED LAKE CABIN – THAT EVENING

(The cabin is modest and cozy. Cris sets their overnight bags down. Dani sits slowly on the edge of the bed, running a hand across her belly.)

DANI:  
Your dad really did all this?

CRIS:  
Booked it, stocked the fridge, left a note on the table. Said, "Make her feel safe." And "Don’t screw it up."

(They share a small laugh. Dani winces slightly and adjusts how she's sitting. Cris notices and softens.)

CRIS:  
We don’t have to... you know, not tonight. We’ve got time.

DANI:  
Yeah. I know. I’m not saying I don’t want to—I just... today’s been a lot.

CRIS:  
Hey. Just being next to you is enough. We don’t need to rush anything.

(He walks over and sits beside her. She leans into him, her head resting on his shoulder. The crickets chir outside. The lake ripples softly through the open window.)

DANI:  
This isn’t how I pictured it. But it’s... better. I think it’s better.

CRIS:  
It is. Because it’s real.

(They sit together in silence, husband and wife, letting the peace of the lake cradle what comes next.)
