# Scene 01 – “The Return”

> Cris hears the truth from his father and decides to find Dani


They don’t talk about it, haven’t for years.  They know the truth. The reason that Cris married Dani is that he knows that she is his angel. He knows that he could survive without her, love does not equal need, but by God, his world, his life, his existence would be meaningless without her. 

He was 25 and she was 22\. She was pregnant, pregnant in a way that no one talks about. He wasn’t the father. He didn’t give a damn that he wasn’t the father. She needed someone to see her, someone to rescue her. Nobody, I mean nobody, gave a shit if she or the friggin’ kid lived or died. In fact, it would be much easier if that kid was stillborn and if she had never been born. She was an embarrassment. For her to get pregnant outside of wedlock was shameful in the 80’s. 

Shameless hussy, got pregnant and wouldn’t tell anyone who the damn father was.  Pride or some shit. Stupid bitch, who the hell did she think she was.  Gymnast, hell. She just was someone to spread her legs and trap some innocent sperm donor into being an ATM for an unwed mother and her bastard for 18 years.  

Cris and Dani had dated  a while back and decided that they were not meant for each other.  Cris was a hard man to love. He couldn’t show it like others. He was a stoic and he couldn’t turn it on and off like Dani needed him to. They couldn’t believe that they were made for each other.  Dani needed a man who would shrivel up and die if he lost her. A man who couldn’t survive without her being by his side.  A man who believed that need equaled love.  

Cris was not that man. He couldn’t be that man, not ever.  Deep inside, he loved Dani, more than he loved anyone else in the world, but he loved her because of the way she made him feel, the way she laughed, the way she held his hand and the way she kissed him goodnight.  And then the way she kissed him goodbye.

Oddly enough, Dani let him go and even though she didn’t pay attention at the time, she survived without him, without the one who loved her so much. Without the one who completed her. She had a very hard time letting go, but she didn’t collapse and die when she saw him driving around town without her. She never thought about it, but she was proving his stoic beliefs every day.

Cris heard the rumors, the vicious tales that would break a strong person, that dehumanized and stripped a person of all self respect. He was back in town to visit his parents and his mom told him how lucky he was to have ducked that Dani bullet.  She seduced someone and then got pregnant and now someone was stuck.  His mom was pretty cruel about the whole thing and Cris didn’t understand why she was so bitter over something that wasn’t her business.  

Cris’s dad put it all right, though. What his dad said, if true, explained why everyone was so against Dani.  His father, the source of his stoicism, did not lie and the tale he told Cris broke his heart.  He looked at his son and the tears in his dad’s eyes told him everything he’d need to know.  Cris was stoic, but that didn’t mean he didn’t believe in divine intervention.  In fact, Cris was a heavy, heavy believer in God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. He was not religious in an organized way, but he knew what he knew.

And the night that his dad looked in his eyes, he knew that someone, something was sending him somewhere he had never thought about going.  He learned his life’s purpose at his father’s knee and from his father’s knowing gaze.  His father answered the only question Cris had.

Cris excused himself from his mom and jumped into his car.  He drove to the address his dad had given him, the answer he’d needed to the only question that mattered.  Cris was so nervous he threw up in the bushes.  He wiped his face and then knocked on the door.

He barely recognized the woman who opened the door. She was six months pregnant, wearing ill fitting maternity pants and a torn t-shirt.  She had been crying, her eyes were so red. She was sick, pregnancy was hard on her. She didn’t look like the gymnast he dated a couple of years before.  

“What are you doing here?” she asked, harsher than she needed to be.  She thought, ‘He’s just here to laugh and give me shit and tell me what a rotten bitch I am.  Asshole. I don’t need shit from him, I’ve got enough to worry about.’

“Dani, can I come in?”

“No, I’m not seeing guests tonight.  I am getting ready to go out on the town.”

“Dani, I see you, I hear you, You are not invisible. I can help.”

“What the hell can you do? How can you help me?  What do you think I am a damn punching bag? What can you do Cris?  Why are you here? To laugh at me?  Well here I am Cris, laugh at me, stupid bastard.”

“Dani, I can laugh harder and better if I could come in.”*Scene body begins here...*

# Scene 02 – The Knock

> Cris arrives at Dani’s apartment and asks to be let in

****

>>>INT. DANI’S APARTMENT – EVENING

DANI: (arms crossed, trembling) Fine. Come in. Don’t touch anything.

(She opens the door fully, stepping back. Cris walks in. He sees the pill bottles on the kitchen counter. The unopened rum. The glass beside it—bone dry. His face tightens, but he doesn’t comment. Not yet.)

CRIS: You still drink that cheap rum? God, that stuff tastes like motor oil.

DANI: (sharp) It’s not for tasting.

(A beat. Cris doesn’t reply. He walks over, picks up the rum bottle, and silently sets it inside the cabinet above the fridge. She watches him, stiff, bracing.)

DANI: Don’t play house with me, Cris. You don’t get to pretend like this is normal.

CRIS: It’s not normal.  
(He turns to face her, finally. Firm. Quiet.)  
You don’t look normal. You look like someone who’s ready to disappear. And if I got here even one hour later, I think you might’ve tried.

(She says nothing. Her jaw clenches. Her hands shake. But she doesn’t deny it.)

CRIS: I’m not here because I feel sorry for you. I’m here because I still love you.  
And because I can’t let you go like this.

DANI: (bitter laugh) You love me? You love this? A disgrace. A freak. The town joke.  
Everyone thinks I made the whole thing up.  
I hear them. "It wasn’t her dad. He’s too respected. She’s just hiding some hookup."  
They think I’m just another small-town slut who got caught.

(Tears start rising. She wipes them furiously.)

DANI: And now I’m going to be someone’s mother? Cris, I can’t even stand being someone’s daughter.

(Cris crosses the room. Slowly. Carefully. When he speaks next, his voice is just above a whisper.)

CRIS: You don’t have to be strong right now. Not for me. Not for anybody.  
But you do have to stay.  
Because this world is a better place with you in it.  
And that kid? That kid’s going to need someone just like you. Someone brave enough to survive being invisible.

(A long silence. Dani doesn’t look at him, but she doesn't move either.)

CRIS: Marry me.

DANI: (choked laugh) That’s not funny.

CRIS: Not a joke.

DANI: You don’t want a broken girl, Cris. You want a wife, not a reclamation project.

CRIS: I want you. All of you. Even the broken pieces. Especially those.

DANI: (screaming through tears) You are full of shit, Cris. Nobody—and I mean nobody—in this town wants me. They don't believe me. They call me a liar. They take his side. Fuck 'em all. And you too, Cris. Get the hell out! Let me go! Let me go, damn you!

CRIS: Dani, I won't let you go. Not like this.

(She shoves him—hard. Her palms strike his chest, once, twice. He doesn't move. He just takes it. Her tears are pouring now, hot and bitter.)

CRIS: I'll be your child's daddy. Give me a chance. Let me try. Dani, there’s two of you now—let me help carry that duty, that privilege. I can be a dad.

DANI: (quieter, but still fierce) No, Cris. No. You can't just ride in and fix this. I'm not some stray you can rescue. This isn't a fairy tale. You think love makes this all okay?

(She looks away. Her voice breaks slightly.)

DANI: But... thank you. For saying it. For wanting to.

(She wipes her eyes again, slower this time. Not calm, but no longer thrashing.)

CRIS: I’m not here because it’s easy. Or because I don’t have other options. I’m here because you matter more than all of them. I’ll give up my name, my job, my future—whatever it takes. Let them talk. Let them sneer. I don’t care.

(He steps closer, steady. No hesitation.)

CRIS: Just give me a chance, Dani. Let me show you what I can do. Not with words—with work. With showing up. With staying. Let me fight for you like you deserve to be fought for.

(As he speaks, Cris begins quietly collecting the pill bottles from the counter one by one, slipping them into his coat pocket when she isn’t looking. His movements are deliberate but gentle—like he’s handling something sacred. He picks up the glass last, sets it in the sink, and wipes the counter with the edge of his sleeve.)

CRIS: Pills aren’t the answer. We are the answer, Dani. We are the answer.

(Dani turns sharply and sees what he’s done. Her eyes lock onto his coat pocket—just visible, the edge of a prescription label peeking out. Her voice drops, low and dangerous.)

DANI: You think I didn’t see that? You think I’m stupid?

(She storms over and snatches the coat from his hands, shaking it. The bottles tumble out onto the floor, clattering like accusations.)

DANI: You don’t get to come in here and clean up my mess like it’s yours to fix. You don’t get to erase the worst part of me like it never happened.

(A beat. She breathes hard, chest rising and falling. But she doesn’t throw him out. Not this time.)

(Then—snap. Dani loses control. Her hand lashes out and slaps him, hard, across the cheek. The sound echoes in the small apartment. Cris doesn't flinch. He just absorbs it, steady and quiet.)

DANI: (through sobs) It’s not fair. It’s not fair! I didn’t do anything wrong. I didn’t ask for this—any of this!

(She hits him again, fists closed this time, pounding once against his chest.)

DANI: I hate that he did this to me. I hate that everyone thinks I'm the liar. That I have to carry this! That my baby has to carry this!

(She doesn't crumple yet. Instead, she swings again—this time, her nails catch his cheek. A line of blood rises slowly as Cris reels back a step but doesn't raise a hand. He steadies himself, blinking through the sting.)

(Dani sees it. The blood. Her breath catches. The fire in her chest dims—not gone, but focused.)

DANI: (quieter, trembling) Shit... Cris...

(She moves without thinking, grabs a dish towel from the drawer and presses it to his face with shaking hands.)

DANI: I didn’t mean—God, I didn’t mean to do that. I didn’t...

(She fusses over the cut like nothing else has happened, like they’re just any couple with a clumsy kitchen accident. Her world stabilizing, one bandage at a time.)

(Cris gently reaches up and touches her arm, his fingers barely resting there.)

CRIS: I’ve never stopped loving you, Dani.

DANI: How? Why? After I threw you out? Why do you love me, Cris? Why me, why you?

CRIS: Because the first time I saw you, I felt something I couldn’t name—like God whispered your name in my chest. Because when you walk into a room, it’s like my lungs start working again. And even when we broke up, even when I hated how much I missed you... I knew.

(He looks her straight in the eyes—gentle, sure.)

CRIS: You're the bravest person I know. And I don’t care what anyone else says. I know who you are. That’s why it’s you. Always has been.

DANI: Brave, shit. Hell, it wasn't bravery that got me into this situation. It was a bunch of ignorant dickheads ignoring what they had to have seen. They must have known.

(Her voice trembles, not from fear—but fury.)

DANI: Cris, why didn't anyone help me? Why didn't they believe me?

(She swipes at her face, angry now. Hurt but clear. This is the root of it. No one saw her. They only saw him. And in 1985, that's all it took.)

CRIS: Because people would rather protect a lie than confront a monster in their own church pew. Because in a town like this, a man’s reputation matters more than a girl’s soul. And I hate it, Dani. I hate that they made you carry this alone.

(He kneels so they’re eye to eye—his voice soft, but steady.)

CRIS: But I see you. I’ve always seen you. And I will never—not once—pretend I don’t believe you. You survived something evil. That doesn’t make you broken. That makes you holy in a way most people wouldn’t understand.

(Dani studies him, her expression unreadable. Then, in a voice barely above a whisper.)

DANI: Then tell me the truth, Cris. If I never get better... if the town never changes... if I scream in my sleep for the rest of my life—are you still staying?

(She watches him closely, needing more than comfort now. Needing conviction.)

CRIS: Yes, babe. I'm staying. No matter what. I'd rather have a bad day with you than an eternity in heaven.

(He pauses, a small wry smile tugging at one side of his mouth.)

CRIS: Well... let me qualify that.

DANI: You aren't pitying me, are you? If you are offering all this just because you feel sorry for me, go the hell away. I don't need that shit right now.

(Then her voice cracks, and suddenly she's weeping—openly, helplessly. The weight crashes down all at once.)

DANI: 'Cause right now, you are all I have, Cris. If you are screwing with me, I... I can't take that. The pills would be better.

(Her eyes lock with his—wide, desperate, afraid. There's no mask now, no armor. Just need.)

DANI: Don't fuck with me, Cris. I can't survive that.

CRIS: Then I won’t. I swear it before God. I’m not here out of pity, or guilt, or some twisted savior complex. I’m here because I was made for this—made for you. I don’t have all the answers, but I have arms that will hold you, a heart that already does, and a spine that won’t break just because life gets hard.

(He reaches forward and draws her into his arms. No urgency. Just warmth. Just presence. Her head rests against his chest, and for the first time in a long while—she lets it.)

DANI: (muffled against his chest) I don’t deserve you.

(A pause. She sniffles, then shakes her head, correcting herself in a whisper.)

DANI: No… no, that’s not true. I do. I deserve someone who sees me. I just… I forgot what that felt like.

(She presses her face deeper into him, clinging now—not to be saved, but to remember what it feels like to matter.)

DANI: Hold me, Cris. Just... don’t let go.

(He holds her tighter, his chin resting lightly atop her head. Silence falls for a moment. Then, softly—)

CRIS: I have to use your phone.

(She doesn’t question it. She just nods against his chest. He reaches for the phone on the wall, dialing a number from memory. It rings once.)

CRIS: Hey, Dad. It’s me. I’m with her. She’s... she’s safe now. I just wanted you to know.

(A pause. Cris listens, eyes still on Dani.)

CRIS: Yeah. You were right. She didn’t need a sermon—she needed someone to show up. And I’m staying.

(He hangs up, slowly. Then speaks to Dani, his voice low.)

CRIS: My dad told me what happened. Told me the truth—what everyone else wouldn’t say out loud. He looked me in the eye, Dani, and told me, "If you don’t go to her now, you’ll never forgive yourself. And neither will I."

(Dani lifts her head slightly, her voice barely a whisper.)

DANI: What else did your dad say?

CRIS: He said, "Son, if you still think about her, if her name still hits you in the chest when you hear it, then she’s not gone. She’s waiting. And if you make her wait too long, you’ll lose her—and yourself. So go. Go now. Don’t ask your mother. Don’t pack a bag. Just go. That girl needs you more than you need to be safe."

DANI: He believes me?

CRIS: Yeah. He knows what a bastard your father is.

(Cris gives her a faint, dry smile.)

CRIS: Don’t worry though—he lost the keys to his gun safe, so the gun is safe in the house.

(Dani studies his face for a long moment. Her eyes shimmer, not with fear now, but something else—something fragile and grateful. Slowly, hesitantly, she leans in. Her lips brush his—soft, unsure—just once. Then again, with more certainty. A kiss not born of passion, but of faith. Of choosing to believe.)

DANI: Please stay, Cris. Unless you worry that association with me will sully your reputation.

CRIS: If we’re gonna get married, the town will have to get used to seeing me around.

(Dani blinks, caught off guard. For once, she doesn’t know what to say. Her lips part, but no words come. Only the sound of her breath hitching, and a slow, stunned smile that dares to hope.)

DANI: You were kidding, right?

(She tries to sound casual, even teasing, but the tremble in her voice betrays her. Her fingers twist nervously in the hem of her shirt.)

DANI: I mean, you don’t just walk in and propose marriage to a mess like me. That’s not how real life works. Right?

(But she’s not pushing him away now—she’s bracing for disappointment, for the moment he laughs it off and steps back. She wants to believe, but it’s all happening so fast.)

CRIS: Oh, baby girl. I have never been more serious in my life. I don't have a ring right now, so you'll have to find a bread tie, but you and I are gonna get hitched and 'right soon!

DANI: We’ve been separated for so long... you don’t know me anymore.

DANI: And Cris, there's one more thing. I'm six months along and I haven't felt the baby kick in a couple of days. Babies born in a situation like this have more birth defects and I don't want to burden you with that. You have given me a rock to fall on and a shoulder to cry on and your warmth. I can't ask you for anymore. Please, just give me your phone number and let me talk to you when I need a friend.

CRIS: Dani, you need me and I want you. I have wanted you since we were little. I have watched you grow—and you likewise. I cannot leave without meeting my destiny. Don't force me away. Dani, I need and want to be with you.

(Dani pulls back slightly, her hands still resting lightly on his arms. Her face is uncertain again—hope wrestling with disbelief.)

DANI: But why? You have your whole life ahead of you, Cris. A job. A name. A clean slate. I’m not that. I’m what people whisper about in the grocery store. I’m trouble. Complicated. Tired. And terrified.

(She looks at him through shimmering eyes.)

DANI: You’d give all that up... for me?

CRIS: Yes. A thousand times, yes. Because what is a clean slate if it doesn't have your name written on it? What is a job, a name, a reputation—if it doesn’t include coming home to you?

(He cups her face, gently, like she might break but also like she might save him.)

CRIS: You think you're trouble, Dani? I think you're the kind of miracle that scares people. Because you're strong, and you're loud, and you're honest. And they don't know what to do with that. But I do. I want to build a life with that.

(His voice drops, more intimate.)

CRIS: I want to wake up and see your face—even if it's tear-streaked. I want to go to sleep knowing I stood beside you, even if the world’s still whispering. I want to be the guy who held you through your worst and never let go.

(He lets the silence breathe, then adds one more line.)

CRIS: So yes, Dani. I'd give it all up—because loving you isn't losing anything. It's finally becoming who I was supposed to be.

(Dani stares at him, breath caught. She wants to believe. Every cell in her body aches to believe. But still—one last defense rises up.)

DANI: And what if I can’t love you the way you deserve? What if all I’ve got is broken pieces and borrowed strength? What if... what if I never stop being afraid?

CRIS: Then I’ll love you through the fear. Through the silence. Through every jagged edge and sleepless night.

(He draws her hands into his and holds them firmly between them.)

CRIS: I don’t need you to be perfect. I need you to let me stay. I’ll carry us both, Dani, until you can walk beside me. And even then, I’ll never let go.

CRIS: Marry me, Dani. We can go a long way together. Marry me. Just say yes.

(FADE TO BLACK.)

Ext. Town Courthouse – Midday

(A small group of townsfolk gathers on the steps outside the courthouse, whispering and giggling behind cupped hands. Word spreads fast in a town like this—and Cris and Dani’s unexpected wedding is the story of the week.)

(Cris stands tall in a clean button-down and jeans. Dani wears a pale blue sundress stretched tight over her baby bump. She looks both nervous and defiant as she squeezes his hand. The Justice of the Peace clears his throat, ready to begin.)

JUSTICE OF THE PEACE:  
Do you, Cristian Luis Salinas, take this woman, Daniela Ardis, to be your lawfully wedded wife?

CRIS:  
I do.

JUSTICE OF THE PEACE:  
And do you, Daniela Ardis, take this man, Cristian Luis, to be your lawfully wedded husband?

(Dani hesitates for the briefest moment—then nods, eyes locked on Cris.)

DANI:  
I do.

JUSTICE OF THE PEACE:  
Then by the authority vested in me by the state of Oklahoma, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss—

(Cris pulls Dani gently into a kiss. The townspeople titter and clap, some with genuine warmth, others with gleeful judgment. Dani hears them but doesn’t care. Not today.)

# Scene 06 – First Night

> They spend a quiet wedding night at the lake house

**

>>>INT. RENTED LAKE CABIN – THAT EVENING

(The cabin is modest and cozy. Cris sets their overnight bags down. Dani sits slowly on the edge of the bed, running a hand across her belly.)

DANI:  
Your dad really did all this?

CRIS:  
Booked it, stocked the fridge, left a note on the table. Said, "Make her feel safe." And "Don’t screw it up."

(They share a small laugh. Dani winces slightly and adjusts how she's sitting. Cris notices and softens.)

CRIS:  
We don’t have to... you know, not tonight. We’ve got time.

DANI:  
Yeah. I know. I’m not saying I don’t want to—I just... today’s been a lot.

CRIS:  
Hey. Just being next to you is enough. We don’t need to rush anything.

(He walks over and sits beside her. She leans into him, her head resting on his shoulder. The crickets chir outside. The lake ripples softly through the open window.)

DANI:  
This isn’t how I pictured it. But it’s... better. I think it’s better.

CRIS:  
It is. Because it’s real.

(They sit together in silence, husband and wife, letting the peace of the lake cradle what comes next.)

# CH_A_S07_LossRevealed



# Scene 07 – No Heartbeat

> The ultrasound confirms the baby is gone; legal investigation begins**

>>>Int. Ob/Gyn Exam Room – Two Days Later

(The fluorescent lighting hums quietly. Dani lies on the table, the ultrasound wand gliding over her belly. Cris sits beside her, holding her hand. The technician frowns and shifts angles several times. A long silence.)

TECHNICIAN:  
Excuse me a moment. I’m going to get the doctor.

(Moments later, the OB/GYN enters and takes over. The room is too quiet. The screen still. The doctor finally looks at them—measured, serious.)

OB/GYN:  
I'm very sorry... there's no heartbeat.

(Dani stiffens. Cris's hand tightens around hers.)

OB/GYN:  
From what we can see on this first ultrasound... your baby boy had several significant abnormalities—conditions we call incompatible with life. Severe congenital heart defects, primary congenital hydrocephalus, and what appears to be severe spina bifida.

(Dani goes pale. Her other hand instinctively covers her belly.)

OB/GYN (CONT'D):  
An autopsy would confirm more details. Given the history, there will also be a forensic component to determine parentage. I'm so sorry.

(Silence. Dani swallows but says nothing. Cris doesn’t let go.)

DANI:  
So... that's it? He's just gone?

OB/GYN:  
I’m afraid so. And because of the nature of the case, there will be mandatory procedures. The state will order a full autopsy—not just to determine the cause of death, but to establish certain legal facts. I want to be honest with you both—there will be a forensic analysis to determine parentage.

(Dani flinches. Cris's jaw tightens. He draws her hand into both of his.)

CRIS:  
We understand. Do what you have to. But please—treat him gently. He was wanted.

(Dani turns her head away, tears sliding silently onto the paper-covered table. She speaks so quietly it’s nearly a whisper.)

DANI:  
He was mine. No matter how he got here... he was still mine.

(Cris leans in, resting his forehead against hers.)

CRIS:  
He still is. And so are you.

**

>>>INT. CRIS’S PARENTS’ KITCHEN – NIGHT

(Cris sits at the kitchen table across from his father, a coffee mug in his hands. The room is quiet. A clock ticks softly. Dani is resting upstairs.)

CRIS:  
It’s confirmed. No heartbeat. The baby... he had too many problems. The doc said they were incompatible with life.

FATHER:  
I’m so sorry, son.

CRIS:  
They’re doing a full autopsy. State-mandated. Forensic exam to establish paternity.

(His father exhales heavily, rubbing his face.)

FATHER:  
They’ll find the truth. And maybe... maybe now people will believe her. Maybe now they’ll see what kind of man her father really is.

CRIS:  
They need to. She’s barely holding together. And if they don’t make him answer for this, I swear...

FATHER:  
You just take care of Dani. Let the law handle the rest. I’ll make a few calls myself.****

# Scene 08 – Justice Begins

> Her father is arrested; town begins to change its tune**

>>>EXT. MAIN STREET – DAY

(A week later. News has spread. The gossiping has stopped. The mood is somber. People whisper, but this time it’s not mockery—it’s fear, and guilt, and dawning shame.)

(Sheriff’s deputies escort a stern-faced man in handcuffs—Dani’s father—out of his house. He keeps his head down as news cameras and townsfolk watch. An agent from the state stands nearby, reviewing evidence with a clipboard.)

TOWNSWOMAN 1:  
They said the autopsy confirmed it.

TOWNSMAN 1:  
Should’ve believed her from the start.

TOWNSWOMAN 2:  
I always said something was off about that man. Didn’t I say?

(No one answers her. They just watch, ashamed. A handful cross themselves. One old man removes his hat.)

(The patrol car doors shut. The engine rumbles. The car pulls away slowly, and with it, the last shred of the town’s denial.)

# Scene 09 – The Offer to Leave

> Dani gives Cris an out; he refuses and reaffirms his vows**

>>>INT. DANI AND CRIS’S BEDROOM – SAME DAY

(Dani sits on the edge of the bed, staring out the window. Her hands rest in her lap, clasped together tightly. The room is quiet but for the hum of a box fan in the corner. Cris enters slowly.)

DANI:  
It really happened, didn’t it? They actually took him.

CRIS:  
Yeah. They did.

(She doesn’t smile. Doesn’t cry. Just breathes.)

DANI:  
I thought it would feel better. Like justice would rush in and make it all... less. But it just feels like someone buried me under the truth.

(Cris sits beside her. She doesn’t look at him, but she doesn’t pull away either.)

DANI:  
I wanted them to see. To know I wasn’t lying. But I didn’t want to be right. I didn’t want it to be this real.

>>>EXT. CHURCH STEPS – SUNDAY MORNING

(A small congregation gathers outside after service. Whispers still linger, but now they’re tinged with remorse. The pastor steps forward and clears his throat.)

PASTOR:  
We failed someone in this community. We let fear and pride blind us. Today we ask forgiveness—not just from God—but from Dani Salinas, and from every woman we’ve silenced or doubted.

(A few heads bow. Others nod solemnly. A young couple walks toward Cris and Dani’s front porch later that afternoon, casserole dish in hand. Then another. And another. No apologies, not yet—but the offerings begin.)

**

>>>INT. DANI AND CRIS’S LIVING ROOM – LATE NIGHT

(Dani sits curled in a corner of the couch, wearing one of Cris’s old sweatshirts. A casserole sits untouched on the kitchen counter. The lights are low. Cris is dozing lightly in an armchair across the room. Dani watches him for a moment—then steels herself.)

DANI:  
Cris... wake up.

(He stirs, blinking himself upright. His eyes focus on her, soft.)

CRIS:  
You okay?

DANI:  
I’ve been thinking... and I need to say something.

(She draws in a breath.)

DANI:  
There’s no baby anymore. People believe me now. They’re bringing casseroles and bowing their heads and pretending they didn’t whisper behind my back. And you... you don’t have to stay. We never consummated the marriage. You can get it annulled. You still have a life, Cris. You can walk away with a clean name. I won’t fight you on it. I promise.

(She says the last part quickly, trying to stay composed. Cris doesn’t answer immediately. He stands, walks over to her, and kneels.)

CRIS:  
You think I married you because of a baby? Because of guilt? Dani... I married you because I love you. I took my vows. You took yours. That wasn’t a placeholder—that was a covenant. I’m not leaving. Not today. Not ever.

(He reaches up, brushes a tear from her cheek.)

CRIS:  
We’re husband and wife. I’m not going anywhere... except by your side.

DANI:  
Don’t say that like it’s simple. Like it’s easy. You don’t get it, Cris—I’m shattered. I’m half a woman and not a mother. I’m the girl who makes people avert their eyes in the grocery store.

(She stands, pacing now, arms crossed tight over her chest.)

DANI:  
You could still have a family. A future. You deserve someone who isn’t carrying this much broken history. You deserve better than me.

CRIS:  
No. I deserve you. Not because you're perfect—but because you’re real. Because when I look at you, I see a woman who faced hell and kept walking. And I will spend every day making sure you never walk it alone again.

(Dani slows, back still to him. Her breath catches, shoulders trembling. She wants to argue more—but something inside her begins to shift.)

DANI:  
Then prove it.

(She turns, arms still folded, face set like stone—but her eyes betray her vulnerability.)

DANI:  
Tell me you’ll stay even when I scream in my sleep. When I flinch at your touch. When I can’t get out of bed. Tell me you’ll stay even when I don’t know how to love you back. Even when I make it hard to love me at all.

(She steps closer—not soft, but fierce in her hurt.)

DANI:  
Because if you can’t promise that, Cris... I need to know now. Before I fall any harder than I already have.

CRIS:  
Then hear me now, Dani—yes. I promise. I’ll be there when you scream, when you flinch, when you shut down. I’ll be there when you can’t love me back, and when you think you never will. I will hold you when you're shaking, stand back when you need space, and stay grounded when everything else falls apart.

(He steps forward, voice low and unwavering.)

CRIS:  
You asked me to prove it—so remember this. When I was twelve and you beat me in every single event at the church picnic, I never stopped chasing you. When you were sixteen and I didn’t kiss you at the drive-in, I thought about it every day for a year. And when I heard what happened, I didn't hesitate—I came straight to you. Not to fix you. To find you. Because you are the girl I’ve always loved.

(He reaches out and gently takes her hands.)

CRIS:  
So no matter how broken you think you are... I’m already here. I’m not afraid of the dark. I’m not afraid of the scars. I married you, Dani. I will stay married to you.

(A beat of silence. Then—)

CRIS:  
Now fall. I’ll catch you.

(Dani stands frozen, heart pounding in her chest. She wants to fight him still, to throw up one last wall just in case he doesn't mean it. But she sees his face—open, steady, unmoving. No fear. No pity. Just love.)

(And then, like a tide finally letting go, she breaks. Her knees give out and she falls into him—not gracefully, but with all the weight of grief, confusion, and reluctant hope. Cris catches her, just like he promised.)

(For a long time, neither of them speaks. Her tears soak his shoulder. His arms tighten around her.)

(Finally, in the softest voice—)

DANI:  
Okay.

(A beat.)

DANI:  
You caught me.

(FADE TO BLACK.)
