# Scene 03 – “I Do, Anyway”

> Their courthouse wedding, community whispers, quiet defiance

**

EXT. TOWN COURTHOUSE – MIDDAY

(A small group of townsfolk gathers on the steps outside the courthouse, whispering and giggling behind cupped hands. Word spreads fast in a town like this—and Cris and Dani’s unexpected wedding is the story of the week.)

(Cris stands tall in a clean button-down and jeans. Dani wears a pale blue sundress stretched tight over her baby bump. She looks both nervous and defiant as she squeezes his hand. The Justice of the Peace clears his throat, ready to begin.)

JUSTICE OF THE PEACE:  
Do you, Cristian Luis Salinas, take this woman, Daniela Ardis, to be your lawfully wedded wife?

CRIS:  
I do.

JUSTICE OF THE PEACE:  
And do you, Daniela Ardis, take this man, Cristian Luis, to be your lawfully wedded husband?

(Dani hesitates for the briefest moment—then nods, eyes locked on Cris.)

DANI:  
I do.

JUSTICE OF THE PEACE:  
Then by the authority vested in me by the state of Oklahoma, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss—

(Cris pulls Dani gently into a kiss. The townspeople titter and clap, some with genuine warmth, others with gleeful judgment. Dani hears them but doesn’t care. Not today.)

INT. RENTED LAKE CABIN – THAT EVENING

(The cabin is modest and cozy. Cris sets their overnight bags down. Dani sits slowly on the edge of the bed, running a hand across her belly.)

DANI:  
Your dad really did all this?

CRIS:  
Booked it, stocked the fridge, left a note on the table. Said, "Make her feel safe." And "Don’t screw it up."

(They share a small laugh. Dani winces slightly and adjusts how she's sitting. Cris notices and softens.)

CRIS:  
We don’t have to... you know, not tonight. We’ve got time.

DANI:  
Yeah. I know. I’m not saying I don’t want to—I just... today’s been a lot.

CRIS:  
Hey. Just being next to you is enough. We don’t need to rush anything.

(He walks over and sits beside her. She leans into him, her head resting on his shoulder. The crickets chir outside. The lake ripples softly through the open window.)

DANI:  
This isn’t how I pictured it. But it’s... better. I think it’s better.

CRIS:  
It is. Because it’s real.

(They sit together in silence, husband and wife, letting the peace of the lake cradle what comes next.)
