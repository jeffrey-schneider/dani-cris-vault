# Scene 05 – “No Heartbeat”

> Ultrasound results, grief, the state's investigation

**

INT. CRIS’S PARENTS’ KITCHEN – NIGHT

(Cris sits at the kitchen table across from his father, a coffee mug in his hands. The room is quiet. A clock ticks softly. Dani is resting upstairs.)

CRIS:  
It’s confirmed. No heartbeat. The baby... he had too many problems. The doc said they were incompatible with life.

FATHER:  
I’m so sorry, son.

CRIS:  
They’re doing a full autopsy. State-mandated. Forensic exam to establish paternity.

(His father exhales heavily, rubbing his face.)

FATHER:  
They’ll find the truth. And maybe... maybe now people will believe her. Maybe now they’ll see what kind of man her father really is.

CRIS:  
They need to. She’s barely holding together. And if they don’t make him answer for this, I swear...

FATHER:  
You just take care of Dani. Let the law handle the rest. I’ll make a few calls myself.**
