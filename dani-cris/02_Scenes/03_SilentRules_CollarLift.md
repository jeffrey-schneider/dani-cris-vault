# Scene 03 – Silent Rules: “Lift Your Head”

The room was warm. Still.  
Dani knelt on the floor, head bowed, collar gleaming in the low light. The leash coiled between them like a boundary she’d agreed to cross.

Mateo sat, relaxed. Not looming. Not posturing. Just **present**.

He didn’t need to raise his voice.

> “When I talk to you,” he said, “lift your head so I can see the collar.”

A pause. Long enough to let the rule settle.  
Not a threat.  
A **structure.** Like a new beam in a house that had already started shifting.

She didn’t argue.  
She didn’t ask why.  
She just moved.

Her cheek lifted softly off her thigh.  
Hair falling away from her throat.  
Chin tilted—just enough.  
The collar caught the light like an answer.

Mateo looked at it.  
Looked at her.

And nodded.

That was it.

No praise.  
No punishment.  
Just the new rule.

And Dani—who once led boardrooms, who carved entire deals with her voice alone—knew she’d remember this **forever**.

> *She hadn’t asked for this.  
She hadn’t resisted it either.  
And that’s what scared her most.*
